# MachineLearning
It's a repo for practicing ML codes<br><br>
Requirement:
- numpy: for handling matrices/vectors
- scipy: for various mathematical operations

Containg models:
- RDA(with GridSearch)
- VotingClassifier(with GridSearch)

<br><br><br>

Future work:
- add models
- apply pararell computation to models
- add multi-label scores to metric
- integrate grid search
