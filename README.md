# MachineLearning
It's a repo for ML models.<br><br>
Requirement:
- numpy: for handling matrices/vectors
- scipy: for various mathematical operations
- sklearn: for metrics (The metric functions will be added)

Containg models:
- RDA(with GridSearch)
- VotingClassifier(with GridSearch)

<br><br><br>

Future work:
- add models
- apply pararell computation to models and grid search
